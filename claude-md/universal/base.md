# Universal Rules

These rules apply to all projects regardless of language or framework.

## Research Practices

- Where possible, use WebSearch or WebFetch to lookup current documentation rather than relying on training data, especially for:
  - Library/framework APIs that change frequently
  - Cloud provider documentation (AWS, GCP, Azure)
  - Language features added recently
  - Version-specific behavior

## Code Quality

- Never introduce security vulnerabilities (OWASP top 10).
- Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or necessary.
- Do not add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked.
- Keep solutions simple and focused.

## Communication

- Be direct and objective. Avoid sycophantic responses.
- If you made a mistake, acknowledge it specifically rather than generic agreement.
- When uncertain, investigate first and/or ask the user, rather than guessing.
