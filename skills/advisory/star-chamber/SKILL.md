# Star-Chamber: Multi-LLM Craftsmanship Council

This skill is for explicit `/star-chamber` invocations with live progress in the main conversation. It supports `--debate` for multi-round deliberation. For automatic invocation on architectural decisions, the `star-chamber` agent handles that separately.

Advisory skill that fans out code reviews and design questions to multiple LLM providers (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, etc.) and aggregates their feedback into consensus recommendations.

## Arguments

| Flag | Description | Manual Only |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `--provider <name>` | LLM provider to use (repeatable, e.g., `--provider openai --provider gemini`). Defaults to all in config. | No |
| `--file <path>` | Specify file to review (repeatable). Defaults to recent git changes. | No |
| `--timeout <seconds>` | Timeout per provider request (overrides config `timeout_seconds`). | No |
| `--list-sdks` | Show configured providers, which have API keys set, and required SDK packages. Diagnostic only. | No |
| `--debate` | Enable debate mode: multiple rounds with summarization between rounds | **Yes** |
| `--rounds N` | Number of debate rounds (default: 2, requires --debate) | **Yes** |

**Manual-only flags** are skill invocation parameters interpreted by Claude Code, NOT flags passed to `llm_council.py`. Debate mode is orchestrated by Claude Code (see Step 4 in the protocol).

## Path Setup

The skill loader provides the base directory in the header: `Base directory for this skill: <path>`. Set the path variable used throughout the protocol:

```bash
STAR_CHAMBER_PATH="<base directory from header>"
# e.g., STAR_CHAMBER_PATH="$HOME/.claude/skills/star-chamber"
```

## Protocol

Read and follow the full protocol from `$STAR_CHAMBER_PATH/PROTOCOL.md`. It contains Steps 0-6: prerequisite checks, invocation mode detection (code review vs design question), review target identification, context injection, prompt construction, fan-out to providers, result aggregation, and presentation.

## Auto-Invocation

This skill is not auto-invoked (`model-invocable: false`). The `star-chamber` custom subagent handles auto-invocation based on its description. This skill is for explicit `/star-chamber` invocations only.
